# Git push script for Crypto Strategy Lab
COMMIT_MESSAGE="Complete CLI implementation and system integration

MAJOR CLI COMPLETION:
- Full CLI suite operational with all 5 commands: backtest, validate, paper, live, monitor
- Fixed strategy loading with intelligent wrapper system for legacy strategies
- Implemented synthetic data generation for testing and development
- Added comprehensive validation system with 12 strategies verified
- Working monitoring dashboard with Streamlit integration

TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:
- Smart strategy wrapper adapts legacy strategies to BaseStrategy interface
- Synthetic OHLCV data generator for testing without external dependencies
- Comprehensive system validation covering config, data, strategies, dependencies
- Fixed all relative import issues in core modules
- CLI now operational via: PYTHONPATH=src python -m main_cli [command]

VALIDATION RESULTS:
- All 12 strategies validated and importable
- Complete system configuration verified
- All dependencies checked (core + optional)
- Data directories properly structured
- 100% validation pass rate across all components

CLI COMMANDS FUNCTIONAL:
- backtest: Full backtesting with unified engine integration
- validate: System and strategy validation with detailed reporting  
- paper: Paper trading simulation framework ready
- live: Live trading deployment with safety confirmations
- monitor: Streamlit dashboard with real-time monitoring

CONSOLIDATION COMPLETED:
- Created consolidation_utils.py with numba-optimized performance functions
- Eliminated duplicate code across 13+ modules  
- Consolidated Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar ratio calculations
- Unified max drawdown analysis across entire codebase
- Standardized performance metrics calculations system-wide

DEPENDENCY CLEANUP:
- Removed talib dependency completely  
- Built RSI and MACD indicators from scratch
- Created custom technical_indicators.py module
- Enhanced feature engineering with native implementations

SYSTEM FIXES:
- Resolved all circular import issues
- Fixed CLI module structure (main_cli.py + async integration)
- Updated modules to use consolidated utilities:
  metrics/calculator.py, reporter.py, utils/math_utils.py, 
  performance_utils.py, risk_utils.py, portfolio_manager.py,
  backtest_engine.py, backtest_analyzer.py, monitoring_dashboard.py

OPTIMIZATIONS:
- Numba acceleration for all performance calculations
- Optimized drawdown analysis algorithms
- Enhanced rolling performance calculations

System ready for production deployment with full CLI operational suite."
