## Trading Strategies Portfolio

### Mathematical Foundation
Each strategy is built on rigorous mathematical principles with formal derivations and statistical validation.

| Strategy | Mathematical Basis | Asset Classes | Timeframes | Target DSR |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| **Lag Autocorrelation** | Serial correlation analysis | Crypto | 1h-1d | >= 0.95 |
| **Variance Ratio** | Lo-MacKinlay drift detection | All | 1h-4h | >= 0.95 |

### Strategy Orthogonality
Strategies are mathematically orthogonal, providing:
- Diversified alpha sources across different market regimes
- Reduced correlation between strategy returns
- Robust portfolio performance during market stress
- Scalable capacity for institutional deployment

## Production Infrastructure

### Deployment Pipeline
```
Strategy Development → Backtesting → Statistical Validation →

- Emergency stops for unusual market conditions

### Risk Management
- **Maximum position size**: 10% of capital per strategy
- **Portfolio heat**: Maximum 50% of capital deployed
- **Stop-loss**: 2% per position
- **Take-profit**: 4% per position
- **Daily loss limit**: 5% of capital
- **Drawdown protection**: Reduce exposure at 10% drawdown

## Mathematical Implementation Details

### Strategy Calculations
All mathematical operations are implemented using standard scientific Python libraries:

```python
# Example: Hurst Exponent calculation
def calculate_hurst_exponent(prices):
    """Calculate Hurst exponent using R/S analysis."""
    log_returns = np.log(prices[1:] / prices[:-1])
    n = len(log_returns)
    
    # Range of lag values
    lags = np.arange(2, min(n//4, 100))
    rs_values = []
    
    for lag in lags:
        # Calculate R/S statistic
        segments = n // lag
        rs_segment = []
        
        for i in range(segments):
            segment = log_returns[i*lag:(i+1)*lag]
            mean_ret = np.mean(segment)
            deviations = np.cumsum(segment - mean_ret)
            R = np.max(deviations) - np.min(deviations)
            S = np.std(segment)
            rs_segment.append(R/S if S > 0 else 0)
        
        rs_values.append(np.mean(rs_segment))
    
    # Fit log(R/S) vs log(lag)
    coeffs = np.polyfit(np.log(lags), np.log(rs_values), 1)
    return coeffs[0]  # Hurst exponent
```

### No External Dependencies

- GARCH modeling uses arch package
- No TA-Lib or external C libraries required
