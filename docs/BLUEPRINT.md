## Trading Strategies

### Mathematical Foundation
Each strategy is built on rigorous mathematical principles with formal derivations and statistical validation.

| Strategy | Mathematical Basis | Asset Classes | Timeframes | DSR Target |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Lag Autocorrelation | Serial correlation analysis | Crypto | 1h-1d | ≥ 0.95 |
| Variance Ratio | Lo-MacKinlay drift detection | All | 1h-4h | ≥ 0.95 |
| Hurst Exponent | Fractional Brownian motion | All | 4h-1d | ≥ 0.95 |
| Drift Significance | Cramér-Rao lower bound | All | 4h-1d | ≥ 0.95 |
| Spectral Peaks | Power spectral density | Crypto | 1h-4h | ≥ 0.95 |
| Permutation Entropy | Ordinal pattern analysis | All | 1h-4h | ≥ 0.95 |
| Volatility Clustering | GARCH modeling | Crypto | 1h-1d | ≥ 0.95 |
| Spectral Entropy | Frequency domain order | Crypto | 1h-4h | ≥ 0.95 |
| VPIN | Volume-synchronized PIN | Crypto | 15m-1h | ≥ 0.95 |
| Wavelet Energy | Multi-resolution analysis | All | 4h-1d | ≥ 0.95 |
| PACF Spike | Partial autocorrelation | All | 1h-4h | ≥ 0.95 |
| True Range Divergence | Price-volatility divergence | All | 15m-1h | ≥ 0.95 |

### Strategy Orthogonality
- Diversified alpha sources across market regimes
- Reduced correlation between strategy returns
- Robust portfolio performance during market stress
- Scalable capacity for institutional deployment

## Exchange Integration

### Supported Exchanges

#### Bybit (Cryptocurrency Trading)
- Testnet environment for safe development
- Live trading with production risk controls
- Asset coverage: BTC, ETH, major altcoins
- Order types: Market, limit, stop-loss, take-profit
- Features: Leverage trading, futures, perpetual swaps

#### Alpaca (Traditional Markets)
- Paper trading for risk-free validation
- Live trading for real money deployment
- Asset coverage: US stocks, ETFs, some crypto
- Order types: Market, limit, stop, bracket orders
- Features: Fractional shares, commission-free trading

### Unified Interface
```python
exchange = ExchangeFactory.create_exchange('bybit', mode=TradingMode.TESTNET)
await exchange.place_order(OrderRequest(
    symbol='BTCUSDT',
    side=OrderSide.BUY,
    order_type=OrderType.MARKET,
    quantity=Decimal('0.01')
))
```

## Production Infrastructure

### Deployment Pipeline
```
Strategy Development → Backtesting → Statistical Validation → 
Paper Trading → Performance Review → Live Deployment → Monitoring
```

### Risk Management
- Maximum position size: 10% of capital per strategy
- Portfolio heat: Maximum 50% of capital deployed
- Stop-loss: 2% per position
- Take-profit: 4% per position
- Daily loss limit: 5% of capital
- Drawdown protection: Reduce exposure at 10% drawdown

### Safety Mechanisms
- Multi-stage validation before live deployment
- Position sizing based on Kelly criterion
- Risk limits with automatic position closure
- Performance monitoring with real-time alerts
- Emergency stops for unusual market conditions

```

## Configuration

### Environment Setup
```bash
# API credentials (for live trading)
BYBIT_TESTNET_API_KEY=your_key_here
BYBIT_TESTNET_API_SECRET=your_secret_here
ALPACA_PAPER_API_KEY=your_key_here

```

## Usage

### Basic Strategy Execution
```python
from src.strategies.lag_autocorr.signal import LagAutocorrSignal
from src.exchanges import ExchangeFactory, TradingMode

# Initialize strategy and exchange
exchange = ExchangeFactory.create_exchange('bybit', mode=TradingMode.TESTNET)
strategy = LagAutocorrSignal()

# Generate and execute signals
signal = await strategy.generate_signal(data, config)
if signal.action != 'HOLD':
    await exchange.place_order(signal.to_order_request())
```

### Paper Trading
```bash
# Single strategy simulation
./scripts/paper_trade.sh --strategy lag_autocorr --days 7 --capital 5000

# Multi-strategy portfolio
./scripts/paper_trade.sh --strategy all --days 30 --capital 10000
```

### Live Trading
```bash
# Deploy single strategy

# Deploy portfolio
python scripts/deploy_portfolio.py --config configs/production.yaml
```
