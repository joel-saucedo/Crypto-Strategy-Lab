## Mission Statement

Build a library of statistically defensible crypto strategies, each passing a Deflated Sharpe Ratio gate and runnable from raw tape to live execution.

### Core Principles
1. **Mathematics First:** Every strategy requires formal mathematical proof before implementation
2. **Statistical Rigor:** DSR â‰¥ 0.95 validation gate ensures genuine edge detection
3. **Reproducible Research:** Complete framework from research to production
4. **Open Collaboration:** Transparent methodology and peer review process
5. **Continuous Validation:** Ongoing monitoring and revalidation of live strategies

### Goals
- âœ… Develop 12 orthogonal trading edges with proven statistical significance
- âœ… Create a unified framework for systematic strategy development
- ðŸ”„ Establish best practices for quantitative trading research
- ðŸ”„ Build a community of rigorous quantitative researchers
- ðŸ”„ Contribute to academic literature on systematic trading

## Research Philosophy

### Evidence-Based Development
- Hypothesis-driven strategy creation

*"In God we trust. All others must bring data."* - W. Edwards Deming

The Crypto-Strategy-Lab embodies this principle by requiring statistical proof for every trading edge, ensuring that our strategies are grounded in rigorous mathematical foundations rather than wishful thinking.
